# Space X

Your task is to create a React application that will consume data from the SpaceX public API. The application must retrieve historic and future SpaceX launches and present them in a list view.
Provided in this pack are a copy of the designs as well as all of the assets you will need. Use the create-react-app CLI tool to generate a new react project and feel free to use any 3rd party packages that will assist in your development.

Designs are available from: [https://sketch.cloud/s/yyv1b/agmoaZP](https://sketch.cloud/s/yyv1b/agmoaZP)

The API documentation is available from:
Postman - [https://docs.spacexdata.com](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)
GitHub - [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

## Stories:

- As a user, I want the ability to load the full list of SpaceX launches from the SpaceX API
- As a user, I want the ability to reload the data to see any new changes
- As a user, I want the ability to filter the launch list by year
- As a user, I want the ability to sort all launches by date (ascending/descending)

## Considerations we will be looking for in your submission are:

- Project approach
- Accuracy of designs
- State management
- Code quality (e.g patterns and organisation of the application code)
- Network logic

## Bonus Considerations:

- Accessibility (A11y) best practices.
- Type Safety i.e propTypes or TypeScript
- Unit Tests

Please complete the task using a Git source control tool such as GitHub or Bitbucket. Remember to commit your code regularly. And as your submission, please provide access and the URL to the repository.

Don't worry if you can't complete everything on the list, try your best and feel free to detail what extra things you would have done if time permitted it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
